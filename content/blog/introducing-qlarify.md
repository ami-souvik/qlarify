Documentation is the bane of every software engineer's existence. We all know it's important, yet it's often the last thing we do—and the first thing to become outdated.

Why? **Because traditional diagramming tools feel like work.**

Dragging rectangles, aligning arrows, fixing layout issues when you add one new component—it’s tedious manual labor that takes you out of your "flow state". You spend more time fighting the UI than thinking about your actual system design.

Today, we're changing that with **Qlarify**.

## What is Qlarify?

Qlarify is a new kind of visual documentation tool built for the AI era. Instead of a palette of shapes, your interface is a simple text box. You describe your system flow, and Qlarify instantly renders a beautiful, auto-laid-out diagram.

> "User visits the landing page. Frontend loads assets from CDN. User submits email form. API validates the email address. Database saves the contact info."

That’s it. You type that, and you get a complete architecture diagram with:
*   **Correct nodes** (Users, Datastores, Services)
*   **Directional edges** representing data flow
*   **Auto-assignment of roles** (e.g., Database icons vs Frontend icons)

## Key Features

### 1. Natural Language Generation
Leveraging advanced LLMs, Qlarify understands technical context. It knows that "Redis" implies a cache, "Postgres" is a database, and "Lambda" is a compute function. You don't need to specify shapes or colors—it just figures it out.

### 2. Smart Iteration
Diagrams represent living systems. With Qlarify, you don't throw away the drawing when requirements change. You simply enable **"Iteration Mode"** and tell the AI: *"Add a Redis cache before the Database query"*. The diagram updates intelligently, preserving your existing context.

### 3. One-Click Sharing
Documentation is useless if it's locked on your laptop. Qlarify lets you generate a **permanent, read-only link** to your diagram instantly. Embed it in your Notion docs, Jira tickets, or generic wikis.

## Why We Built This

We believe that **visual communication is the highest bandwidth channel for engineering teams**. A clear architecture diagram can save hours of meetings and prevent costly misunderstandings.

But the friction of creating them was too high. By removing the manual labor of "drawing", we hope to make visual documentation as easy and routine as writing a commit message.

## Get Started

Qlarify is currently in **Public Beta** and is free to try. No sign-up required for the basic playground.
